# Geometrium

This project contains several algorithms that:

1) calculate convex hulls given a set of points or set of segments.
2) calculate intersection points between segments
3) calculate bezier curves

Additionally, it creates a Java swing window that paints the set of segments or points and draws the results of the algorithm in red.
